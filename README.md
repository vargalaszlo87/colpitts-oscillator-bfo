# colpitts-oscillator-bfo

This repository demonstrates using a Colpitts oscillator as a BFO. It's a simple project, but you can easily use it in your project. Have a fun!

# Short description.

My oscillator circuit has two main parts. The first part is a Colpitts-oscillator with varicap diodes for frequency adjusting. The second stage is a simple common-emitter amplifier that provides gain reserve and signal decoupling.

This circuit can tune the frequency up and down by **5kHz**. 

**Important!** *If your radio uses a different IF frequency, you can adjust the frequency with the LC tank.*

## Tuning section

Only a few electronic components provide frequency tuning.

- C2 and C3
- L1 & L2 (or one L, or and LC tank)
- D1 and D2 varicap diodes
